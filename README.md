- 👋 Hi, I’m @PercyPumpkin. I'm 67 but very new to electronics and the Arduino. I got interested, mid-2023, in charging devices with solar panels.  
- 👀 I’m interested in getting up to speed with the code used to control the microcontrollers that use C & C++.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn the C language and how to construct sketches using the Arduino IDE. Have built an Infra Red controlled direction board for Squash players (called Ghosting).
- At present I'm struggling (spending hours a day) working on a lit button reaction test using radio control (NRF24L01). I've 'bitten off more than I can chew' with this I think!
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment. But I'm interested in any advice on the above. Perhaps, when I've had a little more experience, I might like to collaborate on a project. 
- 📫 How to reach me ? Is it possible through GitHub?
- 😄 Pronouns: I've been a professional Squash coach for 35 years. I spent my early years as a drawn cartoon animator, working on projects with Halas & Batchelor,
- a few Dangermouse episodes & the BFG with Cosgrove Hall productions and finally with Walt Disney/Amblin on "Who Framed Roger Rabbit". 
- ⚡ Fun fact: My name Percy Pumpkin, originated when I was at boarding school & grew a pumpkin plant in the dormitory & at that time the famous gardener on TV was Percy Thrower!
